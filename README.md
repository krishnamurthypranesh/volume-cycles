A proven method to create athletic monsters. Check out Mark Wildman's channel.

I got the idea for volume cycles from him. And, he got it from Pavel Tsatsouline.


# Todo
1. Volume Cycles - Where sets increase while reps per set are constant (WIP)
2. Ability to record notes/thoughts per session
3. Density Cycles - Where sets and reps both change so that the total volume is finished in the same amount of time
4. Time Under Tension Cycles - Where TuT changes while other things are kept constant.
